# CocaCola_Time_Series_Modeling

The objective of this project is to model the series of quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola, from the first quarter of 1983 to the third quarter of 2009. The sinusodial shape of the autocorrelation function is a strong indication for a seasonal trend underlying the data, with a high number of lags out of limits.

Due to its simplicity together with good predictions, significant coefficients and white noise residuals, the **SARIMA**(5,0,0)x(0,1,0) model is chosen.
